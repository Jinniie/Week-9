As you see above, everytime somebody tries to use the 4444 port, it shows the information of the user.


install mhn

$ cd /opt/
$ sudo git clone https://github.com/threatstream/mhn.git
$ cd mhn/
Change config to different usernames and passwords.
After this, connect ubuntu with mhn using the Ip address or hostname "local host"

now, instead of the ip address showing up in terminal, it is visible to the host website.
